# cmp-743-principles-of-communications-networks-hw-code
Python code for all HW for this course.  
Downloading the code and running it might not work, it must be ran as individual folders (ex: "Algorithm" inside "HW 6" only).  
I'll write exact instructions in the future.  
While reviewing everything, I found a few small bugs and additional things I need to fix, but HW 6 looks good (just not the midterm part, I need to figure things out).
